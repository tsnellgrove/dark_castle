"Dark Castle" is a very simple Zork-like adventure game. I have written it in order to teach myself Python. The program is written using Pythonista and Working Copy on an iPad.

The program's language skills are very basic. All commands are either one word (a simple command verb like "north") or two words (simple verb-noun combinations like "attack goblin"). Adjectives are directly attached to the noun they are associated with via an underscore (e.g. "take rusty_key"). There are no articles or pronouns.

There are only four rooms and the puzzle difficulty varies from trivial to moderate as the game progresses. The content is appropriate for kids.

I'm very much a beginner at both Python and text adventure writing so I welcome your feedback and suggestions!
