"front_gate","The front_gate is just north of the Dark Castle's drawbridge. It is 10 feet tall and reenforced with steel bands. Imposing indeed! There is rusty_lettering across the top of the gate and a rusty keyhole next to a handle. The front_gate is closed."
"iron_portcullis","Beyond the iron_portcullis you can dimly make out the next room. The iron_portcullis is closed."
'control_panel',"The control_panel contains three levers: a left_lever, a middle_lever, and a right_lever. The control_panel also contains a big_red_button. There are no directions posted as to what the controls are for or how to use them (a clear ISO lapse is ever you've seen one Burt)."
'left_lever',"The left_lever is down."
'middle_lever',"The middle_lever is down."
'right_lever',"The right_lever is down."
'big_red_button',"The big_red_button is to the right of the three levers. You have no idea what it does but you have an  almost irrestiable urge to push it."
'throne',"High-backed and intricately carved, the throne is secured to the floor and wedged against the castle wall behind it. It does not look entirely comfortable but it must have once been very grand indeed. Alas, like the rest of Dark Castle, it is now dingy and ominous with only faint hints of its past glory. It must have heard many secrets in its time... perhaps it still holds some?"
'stone_coffer',"This is the sort of coffer that, in better days, was no doubt filled to the brim will brightly shining gold pieces. Unfortunately, as you'd begun to fear, those days are long past and now the coffer is filled only with a deep layer of dust."
'crystal_box',"Atop an ornate pillar to the left of the throne sits an intricate crystal_box. Through the glass you can make out and aged but intact scroll that fits perfectly within the container. There is a silver keyhole on the front of the crystal_box that glitters brilliantly - much like the shiny_sword in fact - in the otherwise dark and brooding room. The top of the crystal_box is engraved with calligraphy. The crystal_box is closed."
"rusty_key","An old Rusty Key... the one they gave you at the pub when you swore to pillage the Dark Castle. What could you possibly do with it?"
"stale_biscuits","The stale_biscuits are rather unappetizing. There is a trademark baked into the biscuits."
'shiny_sword',"The sword glitters even in the dim light. Despite its age, the edge is keen and looks ready for action. There are dwarven_runes engraved upon the blade."
'grimy_axe',"A nasty looking weapon - and poorly maintained too. If you ever get out of this castle you should set aside some time to polish it."
'torn_note',"This must have dropped from the goblin's hand when you slew it. The note is ragged and torn. On it there is some messy_handwriting."
'silver_key',"The small silver_key glitters in the dim light. It certainly stands out in the otherwise dreary Dark Castle. If you find a glittering silver keyhole somewhere this is definitely the key for it!"
'scroll_of_the_king',"Wow this thing is fancy! Huge letters with little pictures inside them and all sorts of curvy flourish at the end of each and every letter. Burt, your humble biscuit-baking, pub-crawling brain doesn't even know what to call this thing but if it did you would call it an illuminated manuscript composed (of course) of illuminated_letters. Thanks to the hard and thankless work of your first grade teacher, Ms. Lusk, you could probably just manage to read the illuminated_letters."
'royal_crown',"Giant rubies: check. Dozens of glittering jewels: check. Gleaming gold and precious metals: check. Yep, this is a *seriously royal* crown you've got here Burt!"
'hedgehog_broach',"The silver hedgehog_broach is about an inch in diameter and is carved with the crest of a hedgehog bearing a sword and a key. It's strangely familiar... you've seen one just like it... long ago... examining the hedgehog_broach up close triggers a long forgotten memory... \nyou were only five or six years old... you and all your family were at the bedside of your great grandmother, Nana Baker. She was old - very, very old -  so old no even was sure how old - not even Nana. She'd been unable to eat or get out of bed for the past week and the village healer had given his solemn verdict that at long last her time had come. The whole village had come round to pay their last respects but now it was just family left. She looked very tired and her eyes were closed. \n'Thomas', said Nana, meaning your father, 'I'm weary... be a good lad and go heat me some tea.. Nice and hot please.'. Next she sent your mother off for a special pillow she'd loaned to a friend. Soon every member of the family was off on an errand and it was just you and Nana. \nQuite suddenly, Nana's eyes opened, bright blue and wide awake. 'Well, Burty, finally we can have a little chat. I wish you were a bit older but now will have to do. Tell me Burty, how do ya feel about baking biscuits?' \n'It's na so bad' you'd stammered back. \nNana laughed and gave you a warm smile. Don't feel bad Burty, I wasn't much of a Baker myself - had a bit of a wild romantic streak in me - just like you. You remind me so much of my Willy.. and that's not entirely an accident mind you. Thought I might see a resemblance in your grandfather or father but they were mindful lads and happy enough to be Bakers. I guess it's waited for you to show itself. Probably just as well. \nAh Willy... now don't get me wrong, Papa Baker was a good man - hard working and with a kind heart - took me hand when many others wouldn't have and always treated me good. But you're from different stock Burty, very different. And that comes with some responsibilities.. you've got a destiny 'afore you and that can be hard on young man with no expecting of it. That's why I'm telling you this now. \nYour real great grandpa was Willy... William Herbert... last of the line of Flatheads.. or so everyone's been told. He was a handsome man.. like you Burty.. and unlike the rest of his family - full of romance and laughter and travel and adventure. Could be a bit reckless at times but he had a good heart. He proposed to me right proper he did... didn't really have to... he was so high up in society... and so much older too... but the moment I told him he dropped right to one knee and popped the question. Didn't care the least what people said. Swore we'd elope if the high priest wouldn't marry us... and he would have too!\nAlas, that crazy man... four months before the big day he was wandering about the castle entrance, wearing his bathrobe and crown, smoking his pipe and reading a book as he walked.. as usual.. and boom, he trips on the drawbridge and falls right into the moat... eaten right up in one bite by one of those mean old crocodiles that have swum in it forever. Oh the day I heard the news...' And with these words she touched the hedgehog_broach she always wore over her heart. It was a dark day Burty, a dark day for me an' for the castle and all the lands around. \nSomeday Burty William Baker, someday you'll be King. And when you is, you be a good King... a kind and courageous and bold king.. and when you is King don't ya be going walking off the edge of the drawbridge with no weapon in your hands and breaking young girl's hearts.. you hear me? \nStunned by this strange tale... you began to stammer an answer but just then your Father returned with the hot tea. With a wink just for you, Nana's eyes closed again and she sank back into the bed. Minutes later she was gone. \nFor years and years you wondered what she was talking about.. and eventually you began to doubt the conversation had ever even happened... over time it had faded completely... but here in Dark Castle, with the hedgehog_broach before you, the memory is clear and real.. Nana was buried with her beloved broach.. she had insisted on it... this must have been a matching mate.. presumably worn by Willy himself."
