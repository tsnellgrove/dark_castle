"front_gate","The front_gate is just north of the Dark Castle's drawbridge. It is 10 feet tall and reenforced with steel bands. Imposing indeed! There is rusty_lettering across the top of the gate and a rusty keyhole next to a handle. The front_gate is closed."
"iron_portcullis","Beyond the iron_portcullis you can dimly make out the next room. The iron_portcullis is closed."
'control_panel',"The control_panel contains three levers: a left_lever, a middle_lever, and a right_lever. The control_panel also contains a big_red_button. There are no directions posted as to what the controls are for or how to use them (a clear ISO lapse is ever you've seen one Burt)."
'left_lever',"The left_lever is down."
'middle_lever',"The middle_lever is down."
'right_lever',"The right_lever is down."
'big_red_button',"The big_red_button is to the right of the three levers. You have no idea what it does but you have an  almost irrestiable urge to push it."
'throne',"High-backed and intricately carved, the throne is secured to the floor and wedged against the castle wall behind it. It does not look entirely comfortable but it must have once been very grand indeed. Alas, like the rest of Dark Castle, it is now dingy and ominous with only faint hints of its past glory. It must have heard many secrets in its time... perhaps it still holds some?"
'stone_coffer',"This is the sort of coffer that, in better days, was no doubt filled to the brim will brightly shining gold pieces. Unfortunately, as you'd begun to fear, those days are long past and now the coffer is filled only with a deep layer of dust."
'crystal_box',"Atop an ornate pillar to the left of the throne sits an intricate crystal_box. Through the glass you can make out and aged but intact scroll that fits perfectly within the container. There is a silver keyhole on the front of the crystal_box that glitters brilliantly - much like the shiny_sword in fact - in the otherwise dark and brooding room. The top of the crystal_box is engraved with calligraphy. The crystal_box is closed."
